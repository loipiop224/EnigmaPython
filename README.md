# EnigmaPython
It's a simple Enigma Machine to use, although it is text base.
For encrypting a message, Just set up the pair of letters in the alphabet together, Choose the order of rotors you want, Choose one reflector. Finally, Choose initial positions for each motor and type in your message you wanted to be crypted.
To Decrypte your message, Just repeat the exact same steps and configs and paste in the crypted message and it would decrypted itself.

All information for this project came from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details , Much appreciation
Maybe  i'll make a gui in the future for this project
